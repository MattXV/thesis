    \multicolumn{1}{c}{N} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Objective} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Contributions} \\ \midrule
    \label{row:o1} & To review the current state of audio rendering in virtual environments, assessing their limitations, realism and computational requirements to  investigate their applications in real-time acoustic simulations for complex scenes.\newline &  Chapter 2, 3 \\
    \label{row:o2} & To explore how, in modern approaches to acoustic simulations, visual representations of materials relate to simulated soundfields.\newline & Chapter 3, 4 \\
    \label{row:o3} & To design and test systems to automatically attribute acoustic materials to scene geometry in virtual environments, recognising and distinguishing between materials in the acoustic and visual domains.\newline & Chapter 4, 5 \\
    \label{row:o4} & To study and evaluate the application of sound rendering methods with acoustic material recognition.\newline & Chapter 5 \\
    \label{row:o5} & To design and propose a novel pipeline for acoustic rendering applied to augmented reality platforms.\newline & Chapter 6 \\
    \label{row:o6} & To investigate psychoacoustic and human factors in auditory displays created by the proposed pipeline by testing an augmented reality prototype.\newline & Chapter 7 \\ \bottomrule
