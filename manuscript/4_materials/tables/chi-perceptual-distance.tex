    \caption[Texture-based material recognition correlation scores]{A table showing Pearson $r$ scores for correlation measuring similarity across audio stimuli from simulated soundfields using different acoustic material sets. Generic acoustic materials are defined as $0.1$ acoustic absorption across all frequency bands. Tagged materials are manually assigned, and Predicted materials are inferred from the texture-based material recognition system}%
