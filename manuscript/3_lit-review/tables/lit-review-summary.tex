    \toprule
    Area of Research & State of the Art & Current Limitations & Potential Avenues \\ \midrule
    Sound rendering techniques & Fast techniques that can produce real-time acoustic simulations & Lack of support for immersive platforms & Testing on \acrshort{xr} \acrshortpl{hmd} \\
    Material recognition & Fast and generalisable techniques that can predict material semantics   from any representation of geometry &
      Lack of benchmarking on material recognition on virtual reconstructions   of real space &
      Implementation of material recognition that embeds into spatial   understanding in \acrshort{xr} platforms. \\
    Computer vision in sound rendering &
      Material recognition has been proven effective in sound rendering   pipelines &
      Few example of integrating material recognition with sound rendering and   only with a subset of techniques &
      Propose a generalisable integration of material recognition into sound   rendering, working with diverse environments \\
    Psychoacoustic factors of sound rendering &
      Existing characterisation of psychoacoustics within sound rendering   pipelines &
      Little testing conducted on \acrshort{xr} platforms &
      Studying the application of sound rendering pipelines in immersive   application by evaluating psychoacoustic effects \\ \bottomrule
