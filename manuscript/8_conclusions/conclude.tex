The main conclusions that may be drawn from the body of work.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Visual-Acoustic Mappings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An extended Image2Reverb that integrates listener and speaker positions in the mapping process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A material optimiser based on ground truth RIRs and an agent tasked with painting surfaces with the correct materials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perceptual Response Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perceptual analysis of geometry reduction processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further Psychoacoustic Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ablation study on material recognition pipelines
    \item Ablation study for the resolution of generated acoustic responses
\end{itemize}
