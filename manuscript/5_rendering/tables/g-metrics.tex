    \caption[Ray tracing testing --- sound strength computed across source-listener positions]{G Sound strength values (dB) across the two source-listener position pair grids, see Figure~\ref{fig:rir-recording-probes}. For each grid, two receiver positions are used to measure the sound strength by computing the ratio of instantaneous energy between a near and a far source. Hence, for \textbf{L1} the ratio of energy between \textbf{S1} and \textbf{S3} is measured (near and far, respectively), and for \textbf{L3}, is measured between \textbf{S3} and  \textbf{S1}.}\label{tab:g-scores}
