    \multicolumn{1}{c}{N} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Objective} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Contributions} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{KPIs} \\ \midrule
    \label{row:o1} & To review the current state of audio rendering in virtual environments, assessing their limitations, realism and computational requirements to  investigate their applications in real-time acoustic simulations for complex scenes.\newline &  Chapter 2, 3 & Reviewed key papers and identified limitations and expansion points, informing the development of the proposed rendering pipeline. \\
    \label{row:o2} & To explore how, in modern approaches to acoustic simulations, visual representations of materials relate to simulated soundfields.\newline & Chapter 3, 4 & Developed and tested two material recognition systems. Tested on a real scene and published results. \\
    \label{row:o3} & To design and test systems to automatically attribute acoustic materials to scene geometry in virtual environments, recognising and distinguishing between materials in the acoustic and visual domains.\newline & Chapter 4, 5 & Integrated the material recognition systems on standard acoustic rendering pipelines. Tested on various scenes and published results. \\
    \label{row:o4} & To study and evaluate the application of sound rendering methods with acoustic material recognition.\newline & Chapter 5 & Developed bespoke acoustic rendering pipeline to integrate material recognition. Tested objective and subjective metrics and published results. \\
    \label{row:o5} & To design and propose a novel pipeline for acoustic rendering applied to augmented reality platforms.\newline & Chapter 6 & Defined a vision for acoustic rendering in \acrshort{ar} based on data obtained from tests. \\
    \label{row:o6} & To investigate psychoacoustic and human factors in auditory displays created by the proposed pipeline by testing an augmented reality prototype.\newline & Chapter 7 & Conducted subjective testing on sound rendering in \acrshort{ar} and tested the proposed rendering prototype on a real application. \\ \bottomrule
