    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Objective} & Chapter \\ \midrule
    To review the current state of audio rendering in virtual environments, assessing their limitations, realism and computational requirements to  investigate their applications in real-time acoustic simulations for complex scenes.\newline &  Chapter 2 and 3 \\
    To explore how, in modern approaches to acoustic simulations, visual representations of materials relate to simulated soundfields.\newline & Chapter 3 and 4 \\
    To design and test systems to automatically attribute acoustic materials to scene geometry in virtual environments, recognising and distinguishing between materials in the acoustic and visual domains.\newline & Chapter 4 and 5 \\
    To study and evaluate the application of sound rendering methods with acoustic material recognition.\newline & Chapter 5 \\
    To design and propose a novel pipeline for acoustic rendering applied to augmented reality platforms.\newline & Chapter 6 \\
    To investigate psychoacoustic and human factors in auditory displays created by the proposed pipeline by testing an augmented reality prototype.\newline & Chapter 7 \\ \bottomrule
